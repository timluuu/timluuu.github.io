Assignment 2

	Free Code Camp is an open source community designed to help individuals get a sufficient understanding of JavaScript through a series of exercises. The exercises consist of a four step curriculum that challenges users to practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. The curriculum awards you with their own certificate system, letting you earn a Front end, data visualization, back end, and full stack certification. Their motto, as posted, is “We help our campers, build job-worthy portfolios of real apps used by real people, while helping nonprofits.”
	Free Code Camp is a self-sponsored company established in California. Although they don’t have official sponsors, Free Code Camp pays off servers and other expenses out of their own pocket. The participants of this project is anyone who is interested in obtaining experience in JavaScript, and would like to build a strong portfolio. Free Code Camp has been established for 553 days, as of April 20th, and recorded over 13.8 million completed challenges. They have donated $850,000 in pro-bono code, and $59,296 to nonprofit organizations. In terms of completed certifications, there are estimated to be 1,200 front end certifications, 76 data visualization certifications, and 91 back end certifications. 
	Free Code Camp has their own code of conduct to keep a friendly coding environment. They suggest three things, so that your fellow campers will like you:
1. Compliment your fellow campers when they do good work. Congratulation them when they accomplish something like completing one of our certifications or getting a job!
2. Critique the work, not the camper doing it.
	3. Only argue about something if it’s to the greater discussion.
The goal behind this goal of conduct is to create an enjoyable environment, so the campers are not intimidated while coding.
	In terms of contribution, Free Code Camp provides a GitHub blog with step to step instructions on how to make a difference. They have “Help wanted” tags for issues, and allow users to work on these issues, and communicate with other participants in a Gitter room. It also gives a guideline for users unfamiliar with GitHub, teaching them how to fork and maintain a local instance of Free Code Camp. After the process, your push request is either accepted or rejected, and they give you recommendations of what could be better if rejected.
	Most of the participants have many means of communications, not only limited to GitHub & Gitter. Participants are free to discuss in their Subreddit, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube channel. I looked through their Subreddit, in particular, and it’s very lively with discussion, and fellow peers helping each other out.
